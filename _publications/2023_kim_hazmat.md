This paper involves modeling removal of dye from wastewater using photocatalysis. The predictors
consisted of 38 parameters ranging from experimental to physical parameters which can affect
the reation rate constant which was used as target variable. We compared prediction performance 
of 34 machine learning algorithms. Prior to that a comprehensive feature selection method (Boruta-SHAP)
was applied to filter the predictors. The best machine learning algorithm was interpreted using
model-agnostic interpretation method (SHAP). The interaction effect of various predictors
onto reaction rate constant was analyzed using SHAP interaction plots.
