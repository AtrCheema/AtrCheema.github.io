In this study, we proposed and evaluate a deep learning model for predicting the effluent 
concentration of a CDI process. The developed deep learning model exhibited excellent 
prediction accuracy for both constant current and constant voltage modes (R2 â‰¥ 0.968), 
and the accuracy increased with the data size. This model was based on the open-source 
language, Python, and the code has since been distributed with proper instructions for 
general use. Owing to the nature of the data-oriented deep learning model, the findings 
of this study are not only applicable to conventional CDI but also to various types of CDI 
(membrane CDI, flow CDI, faradaic CDI, etc.). Therefore, by referring to the examples shown
in this study, we hope that this open-source deep learning code will be widely used in CDI research.
