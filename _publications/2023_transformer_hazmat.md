This study compares application two transformer based architures (Tab-Transformer and FT-Transformer)
for prediction of removal efficiency from wastewater. The tabular data consisted of 20 input
features and 1550 samples. The prediction performance of transformer based architectures
was compared with artificial neural networks and tree based algorithms. We found that
FT-Transformer excelled in prediction performance because of its efficienct handling of 
categorical input features which provide contextual information to numerical input features.
