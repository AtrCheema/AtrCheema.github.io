This paper presents application of machine learning and deep learning models for efficiency prediction
in removal of malachite green from waste water. We first compared the peformance of over 20 machine 
learning based algorithms . The hyperparametes of 8 best peforming algorithms were optimized and their
performance was compared with two deep learning based architectures, ANN and LightLSTM. We found
that the CatBoost algorithm performs best in terms of prediction. The performance of CatBoost model
was further analyzed using partial dependence plots, feature interaction plotsnd permutation importance
plots.
