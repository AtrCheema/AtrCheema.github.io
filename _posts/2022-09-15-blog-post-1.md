Scikit-learn has been the lingua-franca of machine learning community for over a decade now. Developed
in early 2000's, the paper about scikit-learn came in 2011. The paper is well written, and describes the
basic principles of the library. The very fact that the paper of a machine learning library is relevant
today speaks volumes about the strong principles and basis of scikit-learning library. No doughty, the
library has influenced many onward machine learning libraries and almost all the 'mainstream' machine
learning libraries have many concepts borrowed from it. This post has been influenced by the original 
paper and my experience of using scikit-learn. The purpose is not to regurgitate the paper, but to
explain it with code examples.
