Scikit-learn has been the lingua-franca of machine learning community for over a decade now. Developed
in early 2000's, the paper about scikit-learn came in 2011 and 2013. The paper is well written, and describes the
basic principles of the library. The very fact that the paper of a machine learning library is still very
much relevant today, speaks volumes about the strong principles and robust software design of scikit-learn
library. No doubt, the library has influenced many onward machine learning libraries and almost all the 'mainstream' machine
learning libraries have borrowed many concepts from it. Since the success of scikit-learn, there has been plethora
of scikits, sickit-optimize for optimization of hyperparameters, scikit-image for image processing, to name a few.
This post has been influenced by the original 
paper and my experience of using scikit-learn. The purpose is not to regurgitate the paper, but to
explain it with code examples.
